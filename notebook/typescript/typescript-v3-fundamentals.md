## why add type?

## course overview

how to think about this programming languague

1. Adding type information to variables, functions and functions.
2. Configuring the compiler.
3. A practical strategy for incrementally converting JS to TS.

```
it doesn't have to be a big, discruptive thing, we don't have to rewrite js, when use correctly, the process can be smoothly.
```

## example

1. run `tsc` command, by default, output es3 code which support from ie6(unnecessary)
2. `tsconfig.json`
3. 


## type & interface

1. type 可以定义任何类型 包含基础
3. interface 只能定义object 及其subType（function arr 等），不包含基础类型（primitive）
3. interface 可继承
