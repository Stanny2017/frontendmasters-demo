## conception

1. time complexity:the number of operations that are being excuted
2. space complexity: how much space are we taking up in memory 
3. memoization: one type of cache, if you caching the result of a function, we call that memoization. 
4. recursion: you have to return somewhere.(note how we get loops out,`return recurFunc()`)

## some cases
 
1. doing `shift()` or `unshift()` of array is `O(n)` in TS;
2. 

## recursion steps

4 steps to write a recursion:

1. Identify base cases.
2. Identify recursive case.
3. Return where appropriate.
4. Write your procedures for each recursion to get closer to base cases.

Recursion can always be implemented as a loop,but in some situations, it's easier to use recursion.
